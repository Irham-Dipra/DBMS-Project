# DBMS Project - Claude Code Sessions

## Project Overview
This is a book management system with a React frontend and Node.js backend, using a SQL database.

## Session History

### Session 1 - July 11, 2025
- Navigated to project directory
- Created this CLAUDE.md file to track session history and changes
- Analyzed database setup: PostgreSQL database named 'litloom'
- Verified database connection: 21 books, 19 users, 20 authors
- Created database status monitoring script (db-status.js)
- Database is healthy and contains real data
- Analyzed user_books table design: well-designed, industry standard approach
- Completed database consolidation: migrated wished_books to user_books, removed redundant tables
- Fixed avg_rating data type issue causing frontend runtime error

### Session 2 - July 11, 2025
