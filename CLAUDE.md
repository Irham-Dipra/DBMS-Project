# DBMS Project - Claude Code Sessions

## Project Overview
This is a book management system with a React frontend and Node.js backend, using a SQL database.

## Session History

### Session 1 - July 11, 2025
- Navigated to project directory
- Created this CLAUDE.md file to track session history and changes
- Analyzed database setup: PostgreSQL database named 'litloom'
- Verified database connection: 21 books, 19 users, 20 authors
- Created database status monitoring script (db-status.js)
- Database is healthy and contains real data
- Analyzed user_books table design: well-designed, industry standard approach
- Completed database consolidation: migrated wished_books to user_books, removed redundant tables
- Fixed avg_rating data type issue causing frontend runtime error

### Session 2 - July 11, 2025
- Fixed rating functionality to not automatically mark books as "read"
- Modified backend userBooks.js:199 to handle null shelf when rating
- Updated IndividualBook.jsx:55 to not specify shelf when rating  
- Updated BookCard.js:317 to not specify shelf when rating
- Added read status indicator (green tick mark) for books marked as "read"
- Added tick mark UI component in BookCard.js:361-365
- Added CSS styles for read indicator in BookCard.css:101-118
- Rating and read status are now separate actions

### Session 3 - July 12, 2025
- Added `logout_time` column to `login_history` table
- Fixed SQL syntax error in logout queries (used subquery for UPDATE with ORDER BY)
- Updated frontend Profile.js to call backend logout endpoint
- **Migrated database from local PostgreSQL to Supabase cloud**
- Updated backend configuration to use Supabase connection
- All data and schema successfully migrated to cloud database

## Database Setup (Updated)
- **Database**: Now hosted on Supabase (cloud PostgreSQL)
- **Connection**: Automatic via environment variables
- **Collaboration**: Both developers now share the same cloud database

## Setup Instructions for New Contributors
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` in both `/backend` and `/frontend/myapp`
3. Backend automatically connects to Supabase - no local database setup needed
4. Start backend: `node index.js` (from `/backend` directory)
5. Start frontend: `npm start` (from `/frontend/myapp` directory)

## Notes
- Database is now in the cloud - no more sync issues between developers
- All schema changes are immediately visible to all contributors
- Login history tracking with logout time is now fully functional
- Project appears to be a book management system called "LitLoom"
