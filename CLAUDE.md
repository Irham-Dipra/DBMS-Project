# LitLoom Project - Claude Code Sessions

## Project Overview
LitLoom is a comprehensive book management and discovery platform with a React frontend and Node.js backend, using PostgreSQL database. Located at /home/dipra/LitLoom

## Session History

### Session 1 - July 11, 2025
- Navigated to project directory
- Created this CLAUDE.md file to track session history and changes
- Analyzed database setup: PostgreSQL database named 'litloom'
- Verified database connection: 21 books, 19 users, 20 authors
- Created database status monitoring script (db-status.js)
- Database is healthy and contains real data
- Analyzed user_books table design: well-designed, industry standard approach
- Completed database consolidation: migrated wished_books to user_books, removed redundant tables
- Fixed avg_rating data type issue causing frontend runtime error

### Session 2 - July 11, 2025
- Fixed rating functionality to not automatically mark books as "read"
- Modified backend userBooks.js:199 to handle null shelf when rating
- Updated IndividualBook.jsx:55 to not specify shelf when rating  
- Updated BookCard.js:317 to not specify shelf when rating
- Added read status indicator (green tick mark) for books marked as "read"
- Added tick mark UI component in BookCard.js:361-365
- Added CSS styles for read indicator in BookCard.css:101-118
- Rating and read status are now separate actions

### Session 3 - July 12, 2025
- Added `logout_time` column to `login_history` table
- Fixed SQL syntax error in logout queries (used subquery for UPDATE with ORDER BY)
- Updated frontend Profile.js to call backend logout endpoint
- **Migrated database from local PostgreSQL to Supabase cloud**
- Updated backend configuration to use Supabase connection
- All data and schema successfully migrated to cloud database

## Database Setup (Updated)
- **Database**: Now hosted on Supabase (cloud PostgreSQL)
- **Connection**: Automatic via environment variables
- **Collaboration**: Both developers now share the same cloud database

## Setup Instructions for New Contributors
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` in both `/backend` and `/frontend/myapp`
3. Backend automatically connects to Supabase - no local database setup needed
4. Start backend: `node index.js` (from `/backend` directory)
5. Start frontend: `npm start` (from `/frontend/myapp` directory)

### Session 4 - July 16, 2025 (Comprehensive Database Overhaul)
- **Major Database Restructure**: Completely overhauled database to support comprehensive book data from Hardcover API
- **New Tables Added**:
  - `authors` table: Enhanced with `author_image` field for author photos
  - `characters` table: Store book characters with name and biography
  - `genres` table: Store book genres separately
  - `languages` table: Store language information with ISO codes
  - `publication_houses` table: Store publisher information
  - **Junction Tables** for many-to-many relationships:
    - `book_authors`: Books ↔ Authors relationship
    - `book_genres`: Books ↔ Genres relationship  
    - `book_character_appearances`: Books ↔ Characters relationship

- **API Integration System**: Built comprehensive Hardcover API integration
  - `proper-books-integration.js`: Main script for importing books with complete data validation
  - Imports books, authors, genres, characters, languages, and publishers automatically
  - Handles rate limiting, data validation, and duplicate prevention
  - Requires 100% data completeness (description, cover, ISBN, language, publisher, country, date, pages)

- **Database Cleanup & Fresh Start**:
  - `cleanup-book-data.js`: Script to safely clean all book-related data while preserving user data
  - Generated fresh database dumps: `litloom_complete_with_data.sql` and `litloom_schema_only_current.sql`
  - Successfully imported thousands of books via parallel API integration (5 terminals)

- **Backend Query Fixes**: Fixed critical database query mismatches to ensure application runs
  - Removed references to non-existent fields (`pdf_url`, `genre_id`, etc.)
  - Fixed character table references (`book_characters` → `characters`)
  - Updated filter-options to use proper many-to-many genre relationships
  - Maintained original backend structure with minimal changes for compatibility

- **Current Status**: 
  - Database now contains rich, complete book data from Hardcover API
  - All backend endpoints fixed for basic functionality
  - Project ready for frontend enhancement to utilize new data fields
  - Genre filtering temporarily disabled (needs proper many-to-many implementation)

## Database Setup (Current)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (local setup restored)
- **Schema**: Comprehensive normalized design with proper relationships
- **Data Source**: Hardcover API integration providing complete book metadata
- **Quality**: 100% data completeness requirement ensures high-quality book records

## API Integration
- **Command**: `node proper-books-integration.js <start_id> <max_books>`
- **Features**: Automatic book, author, genre, character, language, and publisher import
- **Parallel Import**: Support for multiple terminal sessions for faster import
- **Data Validation**: Strict 8-field completeness requirement

## Notes
- Database completely restructured for production-ready book management
- All book data now sourced from professional Hardcover API
- Backend queries fixed for immediate functionality
- Ready for frontend updates to utilize new comprehensive data structure
- Project evolved from basic book management to professional book discovery platform
